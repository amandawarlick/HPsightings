Kashner et al. 2012
"Focusing only on visual line-transect surveys our maps obviously do not reflect all research efforts or represent the complete current state of knowledge about cetacean occurrence and abundance. A full representation of all available information in a common framework, however, will require the development of methods to convert other types of data, either from other monitoring methods or opportunistic sources into a common, area-independent currency (i.e. density)."

Bucker et al 1993
